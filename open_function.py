To open a file in Python, we use the open() function. This function accepts two different arguments (inputs) in the parentheses, always in the following order:

the name of the file (as a string)
the mode of working with the file (as a string)
We'll learn about the various modes in a later mission. For now, we'll just use "r", the mode for reading in files.
